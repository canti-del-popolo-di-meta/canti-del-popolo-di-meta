# Canti popolari della Penisola Sorrentina

A selection of folk poetry from Sorrento Peninsula, with my translation (from Neapolitan into Italian) and notes. It is a work in progress.

You can read it online on [GitBook](https://robertoreale.gitbooks.io/sorrento/). The cover image is a picture by my dearest friend Francesco Saverio Gargiulo.
